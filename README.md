# Client Library Installation

Install the Google API Client Library

`$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client`

and the OAuth2 client library

`$ pip install oauth2client`

# Install OAuth2 Credentials

Create a file named `client_secrets.json`, with the credentials downloaded as
JSON from your Google Cloud Project API Console.

# Download the discovery document

Go to the [Samples page](https://developers.google.com/my-business/samples/#discovery_document), right click **Download discovery document**, and select **Save Link As**. Then, save the file as `gmb_discovery.json` in the same directory as your Python file.

# Run the sample

The samples in this directory uses the built in `sample_tools` utility of the Google APIs Python client to build an API service from the discovery document that you downloaded, and authenticate the user with OAuth. 

Execute the list accounts sample 

`$ python accounts-list.py`

You should now be able to list accounts and locations.
